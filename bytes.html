		<h3 class="project-heading">The Problem</h3>
        <h4 class="project-sub">"Young adults need fast-paced, algorithmic news sources because of lowering attention spans."</h4>
				<p class="white-paragraph ">Between 2000 and 2024, the average human attention span dropped from 
                    12 seconds to just 8.5 seconds, influenced by various factors—most notably the rise of social media. 
                    Today, people dedicate significant portions of their day to fast-scrolling platforms like TikTok and 
                    Instagram. Simultaneously, over the past 25 years, media consumption has increasingly shifted away 
                    from news. Recognizing this trend, our team set out to reimagine how news is consumed. By integrating 
                    the fast-scrolling technology popularized by social media, we aim to make news more engaging and 
                    accessible, bringing it back into the rhythm of daily life.</p>

    <div class="row">
		<h3 class="project-heading">Research</h3>
        <h4 class="project-sub">According to our research, 8% of people engage with news for over one hour per day 
            and 88% of people engage with social media everyday.</h4>
				<p class="white-paragraph ">We began our research by identifying our primary audience as young 
                adults aged 18 to 30. This group is highly tech-savvy, yet the news continues to hold significance 
                in their daily lives. Our secondary user includes older indvduals who use technology to a lesser degree.</p>
                <p class="white-paragraph ">When interviewing these indivudals, we wanted to know a series of things: How 
                    often do they spend each day enagaging with social media versus the news? What is their favorite source 
                    of news? What frustrations do they have with current news sources? What do they look for in a news 
                    source?</p>
                <p class="white-paragraph">Our research revealed some intriguing yet conflicting insights. 
                    While most users reported spending significantly more time on social media than engaging with 
                    traditional news, 95% identified social media as their primary source for accessing news. However, 
                    when asked about their frustrations with news, a large portion expressed concerns about bias. 
                    This response conflicted with the reliance on social media — a platform often criticized as a 
                    central hub for biased content.</p>
                <p class="white-paragraph">Based on our research, we created two personas: 
                    our primary user and our secondary user.</p>
                <div class="row">

                </div>
                <p class="white-paragraph">After conducting research, analyzing data, 
                    and creating our personas, we developed a list of design requirements and cateogrized them.</p>

        <h4 class="project-sub">User Testing</h4>
        <p class="white-paragraph">After creating prototypes, we brought in some users to complete testing. 
            We asked each user to preform each task and provide feedback on their experience. 
            From their feedback, we regrouped as a team, made adjustments to the protoype and 
            produced our high fidelity protoype.</p>
        <p class="white-paragraph">According to our users' feedback, we needed to make a few minor adjustments. 
            To begin we found some of our elements lacked functionality. For example, we included 
            a search bar in the bottom navigation but no search page. We decided to combine Task 1 
            and 2 together, as it made more sense to have them in the menu so users would have less 
            steps to go through. This allows the user to smoothly navigate the reading settings menu. 
            For task 3, our user suggested that we add labels to show what category the article falls under. 
            After receiving this feedback, we implemented categorized labels for all of the articles on our 
            Hi-Fidelity Prototype so users will know what the article pertains to. We implemented a “read more button” 
            that allows users to read the full article on the home or for you page. The last thing we implemented onto 
            task 3 was a horizontal scroller that would show users they can scroll to see other articles that are recommended 
            for them to read.

        <h3 class="project-heading">Conclusion</h3>
        <h4 class="project-sub">Acknowledgements</h4>
        <p class="white-paragraph">We acknowledge that our application is still in the prototype phase 
            and still requires many additional rounds of testing, as well as, 
            making updates and changes to the prototypes based on the responses 
            to the testing before our application is ready to start the development 
            process. We would also like to thank Dave Wang for his support and contributions 
            of ideals while creating design ideas. An additional thank you to Figma, Canva 
            and all of our competitors for inspiring us to come up with our own app features 
            that made Bytes what it is today.</p>
        <h4 class="project-sub">Future Works</h4>
        <p class="white-paragraph">Enhancing accessibility features to accommodate individuals with 
            colorblindness is a key focus for our project. Additionally, we plan
             to integrate interactive elements such as liking, commenting, and 
             sharing to foster user engagement and community interaction. This application
              has provided our team with invaluable experience in professional user research 
              and rigorous usability testing, sharpening our design and development skills. 
              If fully developed, this application has the potential to significantly increase 
              news consumption and engagement across all generations, bridging gaps in accessibility
               and modernizing how news is experienced.</p>
